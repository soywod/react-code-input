## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added React 19 support [#93].
- Added support for [key composnition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/compositionstart_event). Only the final, composed key is now added to the field.
- Added `usePinField()` custom hook to use the controlled version of the PIN field. See the controlled section of the live [demo](https://soywod.github.io/react-pin-field/?path=/docs/pinfield--docs#controlled).

### Changed

- Changed the way validation works. It is more compliant with HTML standards: invalid characters can be entered but validation will fail (and `onComplete` will not trigger).
- Replaced the hand-made demo with [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/).
- Bump all dependencies to the latest.

### Fixed

- Fixed wrong behaviour in React [`<StrictMode>`](https://react.dev/reference/react/StrictMode) [#91].

### Removed

- Removed property `validate` in favour of the standard HTML [`pattern`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/pattern) attribute.
- Removed `onResolveKey` and `onRejectKey` properties in favour of standard HTML validation, including `onInvalid`.
